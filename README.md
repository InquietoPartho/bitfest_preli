# Challenge 02: Mofa's Kitchen Buddy API

This is the backend API for **Mofa's Kitchen Buddy**, a kitchen management system designed to help users manage ingredients, store and retrieve recipes, and interact with a chatbot for recipe suggestions. The API allows users to add, update, and retrieve ingredients and recipes, and interact with a chatbot to suggest recipes based on preferences like cravings for sweet or savory dishes.

## Features

1. **Ingredient Management**:

   - Add new ingredients to your kitchen.
   - Update ingredient quantities.
   - Retrieve a list of all available ingredients.

2. **Recipe Management**:

   - Input favorite recipes (both text and image-based).
   - Retrieve recipes based on available ingredients.

3. **Chatbot Interaction**:
   - Communicate with the chatbot to get recipe suggestions based on your preferences (e.g., "I want something sweet").
